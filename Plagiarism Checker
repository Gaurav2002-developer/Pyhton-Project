Plagiarism is the act of using someone else’s work, ideas, or intellectual property without proper attribution or permission and presenting it as one’s own. 
It involves copying or closely imitating the content,
ideas, or expressions created by others, whether it’s written text, research findings, art, music, software, or any other form of creative or intellectual work.
